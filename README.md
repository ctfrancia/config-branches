# config-branches

`Config Branches` as it is called now, is an independent standalone for managing varios config files across various branches. For example it's not uncommon to have a `staging`, `uat`, `master/main` or
`production` branch. From my time I have seen various ways to do this and the one that I am more closely aligned with is loading a specific branch's config file for internal information such as a `url` or db credentials.
